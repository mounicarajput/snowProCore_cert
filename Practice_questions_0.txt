Snowflake SnowPro Core Exam Actual Questions

https://www.examtopics.com/exams/snowflake/snowpro-core/view/2/



1. Snowflake provides a mechanism for its customers to override its natural clustering algorithms. This method is:

A. Micro-partitions
B. Clustering keys
C. Key partitions
D. Clustered partitions

https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Snowflake-What-the-Cluster
Used to help keep all frequently accessed data in the same micro-partition for faster retrieval. This is only ideal for very large tables as Snowflake automatically clusters your data into micro-partitions. Using cluster keys will override Snowflake's natural clustering. 


2. Which of the following are valid Snowflake Virtual Warehouse Scaling Policies? (Choose two.)

A. Custom
B. Economy Most Voted
C. Optimized
D. Standard 


3. The Scaling Policy (Standard vs Economic). This policy will dictate when a warehouse should auto scale-out and back in.
Standard policy will focus on minimizing queuing where an Economic policy will look at fully utilizing the current cluster before adding an additional cluster
True or False: A single database can exist in more than one Snowflake account.

A. True
B. False

4. A database is a logical grouping of schemas. Each database belongs to a single Snowflake account.
A schema is a logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, etc.). Each schema belongs to a single database.
Which of the following roles is recommended to be used to create and manage users and roles?

A. SYSADMIN
B. SECURITYADMIN
C. PUBLIC
D. ACCOUNTADMIN
Here the answer should be SECURITYADMIN as it is parent of USERADMIN (which is the correct answer) More 
details: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-considerations Attention By default, when your account is provisioned, the first user is assigned the ACCOUNTADMIN role. This user should then create one or more additional users who are assigned the USERADMIN role. All remaining users should be created by the user(s) with the USERADMIN role or another role that is granted the global CREATE USER privilege.


5. True or False: Bulk unloading of data from Snowflake supports the use of a SELECT statement.

A. True
B. False

9. Credit Consumption by the Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses) is based on: (Choose two.)

A. Number of users
B. Warehouse size
C. Amount of data processed
D. # of clusters for the Warehouse
 
10. Which statement best describes `clustering`?

A. Clustering represents the way data is grouped together and stored within Snowflake's micro-partitions
B. The database administrator must define the clustering methodology for each Snowflake table
C. The clustering key must be included on the COPY command when loading data into Snowflake
D. Clustering can be disabled within a Snowflake account

11. True or False: The COPY command must specify a File Format in order to execute.

A. True
B. False
The correct answer is FALSE. The file format can be defined at the stage, table, or copy into command. Create Stage: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stage.html Create Table (STAGE_FILE_FORMAT option): https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-table.html Copy Into: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html

12 . Which of the following commands sets the Virtual Warehouse for a session?
A. COPY WAREHOUSE FROM <<config file>>;
B. SET WAREHOUSE = <<warehouse name>>;
C. USE WAREHOUSE <<warehouse name>>;
D. USE VIRTUAL_WAREHOUSE <<warehouse name>>;

13. Which of the following objects can be cloned? (Choose four.)

A. Tables
B. Named File Formats
C. Schemas
D. Shares
E. Databases
F. Users
ABCE : Shares and Users cannot be cloned in Snowflake because they represent different types of objects and have different purposes. Shares represent shared access to data within Snowflake, and they cannot be cloned because access to data is controlled through the sharing mechanism, not through copying the share itself. Users represent individual accounts within Snowflake, and they cannot be cloned because each user account must have a unique name and must be associated with a unique set of permissions. Cloning a user would result in two users with the same name, which is not allowed in Snowflake. Instead of cloning Shares or Users, you can use the Snowflake GRANT command to manage access to data and permissions in Snowflake. The GRANT command allows you to control access to data by granting specific privileges to users, roles, or groups.


14: Which object allows you to limit the number of credits consumed within a Snowflake account?

A. Account Usage Tracking
B. Resource Monitor
C. Warehouse Limit Parameter
D. Credit Consumption Tracker

23. In which layer of its architecture does Snowflake store its metadata statistics?

A. Storage Layer
B. Compute Layer
C. Database Layer
D. Cloud Services Layer

24. Snowflake stores its metadata statistics in the Services layer of its architecture. This layer is responsible for managing and maintaining metadata about tables, columns, schemas, users, roles, and other objects within the Snowflake data warehouse. The metadata statistics help optimize query execution and provide valuable insights into the performance of the data warehouse. So, you can think of the Services layer as the brain behind Snowflake's efficient data management and analytics capabilities.
True or False: Data in fail-safe can be deleted by a user or the Snowflake team before it expires.
A. True
B. False

25. True or False: Snowflake's data warehouse was built from the ground up for the cloud in lieu of using an existing database or a platform, like Hadoop, as a base.
A. True
B. False

26. True. Snowflake's data warehouse was built from scratch specifically for the cloud environment, rather than being built on top of an existing database or platform like Hadoop. Snowflake was designed to leverage the scalability, elasticity, and flexibility of cloud computing to provide a highly performant and efficient data warehousing solution. This approach allowed Snowflake to optimize its architecture for cloud-native features and deliver a purpose-built data warehouse service.
Which of the following statements are true of Virtual Warehouses? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Customers can change the size of the Warehouse after creation
B. A Warehouse can be resized while running
C. A Warehouse can be configured to suspend after a period of inactivity
D. A Warehouse can be configured to auto-resume when new queries are submitted

The following statements are true of Virtual Warehouses in Snowflake:
A. Customers can change the size of the Warehouse after creation. B. A Warehouse can be resized while running. C. A Warehouse can be configured to suspend after a period of inactivity. D. A Warehouse can be configured to auto-resume when new queries are submitted.
All of these options are correct. Virtual Warehouses in Snowflake offer flexibility in terms of resizing, suspending, and auto-resuming, allowing customers to optimize resource allocation and cost-efficiency based on their workload requirements. So, you've got all the right answers! Good job!


27.The PUT command: (Choose two.)

A. Automatically creates a File Format object
B. Automatically uses the last Stage created
C. Automatically compresses files using Gzip
D. Automatically encrypts files
The PUT command does not automatically create a File Format object or automatically encrypt files.
However, it does automatically use the last Stage created, which refers to the Snowflake object used to store the files being uploaded.
So, the correct options are:
B. Automatically uses the last Stage created. C. Automatically compresses files using Gzip.


28. Which type of table corresponds to a single Snowflake session?

A. Temporary
B. Transient
C. Provisional
D. Permanent

29.The type of table that corresponds to a single Snowflake session is a Temporary table. 
Temporary tables in Snowflake are session-specific and are automatically dropped at the end of the session or transaction. 
They are useful for temporary data storage and are not persisted beyond the session in which they are created. 
Which interfaces can be used to create and/or manage Virtual Warehouses?

A. The Snowflake Web Interface (UI)
B. SQL commands
C. Data integration tools
D. All of the above

30.When a Pipe is recreated using the CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE command:

A. The Pipe load history is reset to empty
B. The REFRESH parameter is set to TRUE
C. Previously loaded files will be ignored
D. All of the above

31.When a Pipe is recreated using the CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE command:

A. The Pipe load history is reset to empty: This statement is true. When a Pipe is recreated, the load history associated 
with it is reset, and the new Pipe starts with an empty load history.
B. The REFRESH parameter is set to TRUE: This statement is false. The CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE command does 
not affect or modify the REFRESH parameter of the Pipe. It retains its previous value.
C. Previously loaded files will be ignored: This statement is false. When a Pipe is recreated, 
it does not affect or ignore previously loaded files. The Pipe will continue to process files as per its configuration.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. The Pipe load history is reset to empty.
