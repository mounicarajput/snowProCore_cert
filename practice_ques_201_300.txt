202. Which COPY INTO command outputs the data into one file?

A. SINGLE=TRUE

C. FILE_NUMBER=1

203. In which scenarios would a user have to pay Cloud Services costs? (Choose two.)

A. Compute Credits = 50 Credits Cloud Services = 10
B. Compute Credits = 80 Credits Cloud Services = 5
C. Compute Credits = 100 Credits Cloud Services = 9
D. Compute Credits = 120 Credits Cloud Services = 10
E. Compute Credits = 200 Credits Cloud Services = 26

Ans: AE

A: 10/50 = 20% (exceeds 10%)
B: 5/80 = 6.25% (does not exceed 10%)
C: 9/100 = 9% (does not exceed 10%)
D: 10/120 = 8.33% (does not exceed 10%)
E: 26/200 = 13% (exceeds 10%)

Based on your calculations, the scenarios where Cloud Services costs exceed 10% of the Compute Costs are A and E. 
Therefore, in these scenarios, the user would have to pay Cloud Services cost
