101. Which of the following statements is true of Snowflake micro-partitioning?
A. Micro-partitioning has been known to introduce data skew
B. Micro-partitioning: requires a partitioning schema to be defined up front
C. Micro-partitioning is transparently completed using the ordering that occurs when the data is inserted/loaded
D. Micro-partitioning can be disabled within a Snowflake account

Ans. C

Snowflake's micro-partitioning is transparent to users and is completed automatically as data is 
inserted or loaded into tables. It leverages clustering keys to organize data within each micro-partition, 
enhancing query performance without the need for users to define partitioning schemas upfront.

102. True or False: Snowflake bills for a minimum of five minutes each time a Virtual Warehouse is started.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

It bills for minimum 1 minute.

103. When scaling up Virtual Warehouses by increasing Virtual Warehouse t-shirt size, you are primarily scaling for improved:
A. Concurrency
B. Performance

Ans: B

104. As a best practice, clustering keys should only be defined on tables of which minimum size?
A. Multi-Kilobyte (KB) Range
B. Multi-Megabyte (MB) Range
C. Multi-Gigabyte (GB) Range
D. Multi-Terabyte (TB) Range

Ans: D

Considerations for Choosing Clustering for a Table
Whether you want faster response times or lower overall costs, 
clustering is best for a table that meets all of the following criteria:
The table contains a large number of micro-partitions. Typically, 
this means that the table contains multiple terabytes (TB) of data.

105. How a Snowpipe charges calculated?
A. Per-second/per Warehouse size
B. Per-second/per-core granularity
C. Number of Pipes in account
D. Total storage bucket size

Ans: B

Snowpipeâ€™s serverless compute model, users can initiate any size load without managing a virtual warehouse

106. True or False: A Snowflake account is charged for data stored in both Internal and External Stages.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

107. True or False: When active, a Pipe requires a dedicated Virtual Warehouse to execute.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

108. True or False: Snowflake supports federated authentication in all editions.
A. True
B. False

Ans: A

109. True or False: When a new Snowflake object is created, it is automatically owned by the user who created it.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

Any objects created after the command is issued are owned by the role in use when the object is created.
