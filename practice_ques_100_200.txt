101. Which of the following statements is true of Snowflake micro-partitioning?
A. Micro-partitioning has been known to introduce data skew
B. Micro-partitioning: requires a partitioning schema to be defined up front
C. Micro-partitioning is transparently completed using the ordering that occurs when the data is inserted/loaded
D. Micro-partitioning can be disabled within a Snowflake account

Ans. C

Snowflake's micro-partitioning is transparent to users and is completed automatically as data is 
inserted or loaded into tables. It leverages clustering keys to organize data within each micro-partition, 
enhancing query performance without the need for users to define partitioning schemas upfront.

102. True or False: Snowflake bills for a minimum of five minutes each time a Virtual Warehouse is started.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

It bills for minimum 1 minute.

103. When scaling up Virtual Warehouses by increasing Virtual Warehouse t-shirt size, you are primarily scaling for improved:
A. Concurrency
B. Performance

Ans: B

104. As a best practice, clustering keys should only be defined on tables of which minimum size?
A. Multi-Kilobyte (KB) Range
B. Multi-Megabyte (MB) Range
C. Multi-Gigabyte (GB) Range
D. Multi-Terabyte (TB) Range

Ans: D

Considerations for Choosing Clustering for a Table
Whether you want faster response times or lower overall costs, 
clustering is best for a table that meets all of the following criteria:
The table contains a large number of micro-partitions. Typically, 
this means that the table contains multiple terabytes (TB) of data.

112.Which of the following are options when creating a Virtual Warehouse? (Choose two.)
A. Auto-suspend
B. Auto-resume

Ans: AB

113. Which formats are supported for unloading data from Snowflake? (Choose two.)
A. Delimited (CSV, TSV, etc.)
B. Avro
C. JSON
D. ORC
Ans: AC

Supported file formats
Delimited files (CSV, TSV, etc.)
JSON
Parquet

114. True or False: Data Providers can share data with only the Data Consumer.
A. True
B. False

Ans: False

115. The fail-safe retention period is how many days?
A. 1 day
B. 7 days
C. 45 days
D. 90 days

Ans: B

116. True or False: Once created, a micro-partition will never be changed.
A. True
B. False

Ans: A

117. What services does Snowflake automatically provide for customers that they may have been responsible for with their on-premise system? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Installing and configuring hardware
B. Patching software
C. Physical security
D. Maintaining metadata and statistics

Ans: BD

SNOWFLAKE is a true self-managed service, meaning:
• There is no hardware (virtual or physical) to select, install, configure, or manage.
• There is virtually no software to install, configure, or manage.
• Ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning are handled by Snowflake.

118. Which of the following statements would be used to export/unload data from Snowflake?
A. COPY INTO @stage
B. EXPORT TO @stage
C. INSERT INTO @stage
D. EXPORT_TO_STAGE(stage => @stage, select => 'select * from t1');

Ans: A

119. True or False: A 4X-Large Warehouse may, at times, take longer to provision than a X-Small Warehouse.
A. True
B. False

Ans: A

Signed up for free Snowflake account. Created X-Small and 4X Virtual 
Warehouse using web interface. X-Small took 96 ms, while 4X took 105 ms. 
You can validate it in Activity -> Query History.

120. How would you determine the size of the virtual warehouse used for a task?
A. Root task may be executed concurrently (i.e. multiple instances), it is recommended to leave some margins in the execution window to avoid missing instances of execution
B. Querying (SELECT) the size of the stream content would help determine the warehouse size. For example, if querying large stream content, use a larger warehouse size
C. If using the stored procedure to execute multiple SQL statements, it's best to test run the stored procedure separately to size the compute resource first
D. Since task infrastructure is based on running the task body on schedule, it's recommended to configure the virtual warehouse for automatic concurrency handling using Multi-cluster warehouse (MCW) to match the task schedule

Ans: C

This option suggests that before executing the task, it's beneficial to 
test run the stored procedure separately to understand the compute resource requirements. 
This allows you to determine the appropriate size of the virtual warehouse needed to execute the task efficiently.

121. The Information Schema and Account Usage Share provide storage information for which of the following objects? (Choose three.)
A. Users
B. Tables
C. Databases
D. Internal Stages

Ans: BCD

122. What is the default File Format used in the COPY command if one is not specified?
A. CSV
B. JSON

A. True
B. False

Ans: B

126. True or False: Loading data into Snowflake requires that source data files be no larger than 16MB.
A. True

128. True or False: When you create a custom role, it is a best practice to immediately grant that role to ACCOUNTADMIN.
A. True
B. False

Ans: B

129. Which of the following accurately represents how a table fits into Snowflake's logical container hierarchy?
A. Account -> Schema -> Database -> Table
B. Account -> Database -> Schema -> Table

Ans: B

130. True or False: All Snowflake table types include fail-safe storage.
A. True
B. False

Ans: A

All Snowflake table types, including permanent, temporary, and transient tables, 
include fail-safe storage. Fail-safe storage ensures that data is protected against 
hardware failures by automatically replicating data across multiple storage devices 
within the Snowflake system. This redundancy ensures high availability and durability 
of the data, regardless of the table type.
